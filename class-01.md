# Class 01 Reading Notes

When building a website, there are a few things to keep in mind. The first being how are you going to structure your page. If you go to any website, it is going to be organized and pretty easy to navigate, because of the way it is structured. Without good structure to a page, things can be disorganized and hard to find for the user. Another important thing is to have markup in your HTML. Markup is a way o change the look of certain paragraphs and text. Without markup, your text would all look the same whether it is a header/title or just text in a paragraph. HTML5 is also very helpful to programmers today, because now they dont have to have div tags to divide up the page. Each name of the element now describes the content that will be in them making it much more simple. Along with these things, The way you design your website should match the demographic of who will be visiting the site. For example, if you were building a website for young children to play learning games, you would maybe think about making the page more colorful and easier to navigate.
