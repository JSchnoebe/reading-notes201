# Class 02 Reading Notes

## HTML

HTML is a very important language in coding. HTML, also known as, Hyper Text Markup Language, is the standard language for creating a web page. Without it, your web page would have no content. In using HTML, there are many different forms of markdown you can use to change the look of the text on your page. If you wanted a header on your page, you would use the header tag. If you wanted a paragraph you would use the paragraph tag. You can also change the styl of the font, for instance you could make some words bold and others italicized. There are so many different ways to use markdown so having a cheat sheet is always helpful.

## CSS

CSS is used to make your webpage more attractive. So when you have your HTML finished, the page will be very plain and the text is layed out from top to bottom of the page with no real organization. Not only can CSS help with making your page more attractive, it can also make it easier to read and navigate for the user. CSS is layed out with the selector being first, and the declaration after. The declaration is split up into two parts, the property and the value. Here is an example:
p{
color: red;}

## JavaScript

JavaScript is the most exciting language in my opinion. JavaScript gives programmers a way of making the web page interactive. For example adding buttons, links, music, videos, and many other things. There are many terms in JavaScript to be learned, but one of the main things that are used a lot are variables. Variables store bits of data to be used later in commands. Variable names can be anything you want, but every variable name can be given a value using assignment operators.
