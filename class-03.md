## Lists

Lists are used a lot in coding. There are a few different ways to make a list. The two main syntaxes are **ol** and **ul**. The syntax **ol** stands for ordered list, and **ul** stands for un-ordered list. Inside of the commands using this syntax, you use use the syntax **li** that identify the listed items.
