# Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

## Problem Domain

There are many difficulties when it comes to coding, but the trickiest part of coding is problem domain. Problem domain is essentially where the problem comes from. Finding the source of the problem, or just finding the problem in general can be very difficult. You can liken it to doing a puzzle with a similar pattern on every piece, making it hard to solve.

## Object Literals

Object Literals are the name you give to a specific thing in your website. For example if you have a picture of a dog swimming to put on your page, the object litteral might be "Dog Swimming" while the image it's self will be a .jpeg file. Object literals can have classes or be defined and given parameters.

## DOM

The DOM tree is the structure of a web page. Whenever a page is loaded it creates a model of that page and stores it in the DOM tree. Document Object Model Allows you to access certain elements from a branch, and also child elements to work with and change the attributes.
