## Domain Modeling

Domain modeling is a very useful tool in building a website. Lets say you are working for the MLB building a website for team rosters. It would be very difficult to constantly change every transaction or a players stats from scratch, and that is where domain modeling comes in handy. Domain modeling is basically framework that you build out, that allows you to easily innerchange certain elements without having to start from scratch.

## Functons, Methods, and Objects

In order for domain modeling to work, you need functions and objects. Objects can have different attributes that can be innerchanged, and functions help you impliment those changes to the object. We use functions when we dont want to call a command over and over, but rather build one function that we can use whenever we want.
