# Forms and JS Events

## Forms

Forms are common in all websites. The search box on google is a form. There are many different form controls, such as adding text (like a search bar), making choices (like check boxes), and submitting forms (like a subscribe button).

## Lists, Tables & Forms

Lists are also a common thing used in web pages. Have you ever seen a list of ingredients, or instructions on a web page? Those are all made using the li tag. Tables are similar, but they store data that can be changed. For example, a table may have the amount of sales in a year a company had, and could be seen on their website.

## Events

Events are things that happen to the computer as the user interacts. Examples of this could be clicking with your mouse or hitting a key on your keyboard. These events are triggered in JavaScript. JavaScript triggers these. The first thing to do is select the element. Next is indicate which event will be triggered. Finally you state the code you want to run.
