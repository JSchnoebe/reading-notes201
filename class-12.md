# Charts.js & Canvas

## Charts.js

Charts.js is a JavaScript plugin that uses the Canvas element to make a graph on your webpage. Using this plugin makes it much easier to make all kinds of different charts. To use Charts.js, you first have to dowload it and enter the script to your html. When using this plugin, you use the element Canvas to build your chart.

## Canvas

The Canvas element looks similar to an img tag, but there are a few differences. The img tag must have an alt, where as the Canvas tag only has two attributes, which are the width and height. These tags are optional, but Canvas tags need a closing tag. Without the closing tag, the content inside the canvas element would not be displayed.
